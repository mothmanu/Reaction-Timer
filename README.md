# Reaction Timer
In this project, we’re going to be creating a reaction timer that measures the reaction time of a person using the ATmega328p microcontroller. The way the device will measure the reaction time of a person is by making a user friendly device that allows the user to read instructions off an LCD and use a button to enable the functionality of the reaction timer as follows: The button will be used to start the reaction timer. After a random period of time, the LED will flash, and the user will press the button to react to said flash. The reaction timer will then capture the elapsed time from when the LED flashes to when the button is pressed and output the data onto the LCD. After a few seconds, the entire process will be restarted automatically. The purpose of this creation is to improve people’s reaction speeds and how quickly they process information.
